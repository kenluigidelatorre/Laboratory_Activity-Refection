    <h1>Essay: Introduction to Web Development</h1>

    <p>
        Learning about web development was a new and fun experience for me. 
        Before this lesson, I had no idea how websites were made or what kind of codes were used to create them. 
        I only knew how to use the internet, but now I understand that HTML is the language that gives websites their structure. 
        It’s amazing how simple lines of code can make texts, images, and links appear on a web page. 
        This lesson helped me appreciate how websites are made and how developers work to make them look nice and organized.

        At first, I found HTML a bit confusing because of the different tags and symbols. 
        But after a few tries, I started to understand how they work. 
        The head part contains the title and page information, while the body part shows the main content. 
        I also learned that even one small mistake, like forgetting to close a tag, can mess up the whole page. 
        It made me more careful, patient, and focused when writing my code. 
        Seeing the result of what I made on the browser gave me a sense of accomplishment.

        I also realized that web development is not just about coding—it’s also about creativity. 
        You can design a page the way you want it to look and add your own ideas. 
        I learned that using HTML can be both challenging and fun because you get to control how your website appears. 
        It’s like building something from scratch and watching it come to life on the screen. 
        This made me appreciate how important HTML is as the foundation of web development.
        <br><br>
        Another thing I liked is how organized HTML is. 
        It’s like writing a story—you have to follow a format to make it clear and easy to understand. 
        I feel proud that I can now write a simple webpage on my own using what I’ve learned in class. 
        This experience gave me more confidence to try other coding lessons in the future.

        After learning HTML, I want to create my own personal website someday. 
        I want it to have my picture, my hobbies, and some of my school projects. 
        I want to make it simple but meaningful, something that represents who I am. 
        This lesson inspired me to keep learning and to be more creative with my work. 
        I believe that this is just the start of my journey in web development, and I’m excited to learn more about CSS and JavaScript soon.
